# Git Excercise insights

1. I tried to commit some sample files and checked how git stores the data. Then, I tried to commit two files with same data and checked stored objects.
2. When I try to see staging changes, I found that it is not showing the deleted file with this command but using `git status`, I was able to see it.
3. We can only reset staged changes.
4. I tried to make multiple stash and try to apply stash of last index.
